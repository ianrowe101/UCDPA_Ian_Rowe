I have loaded in my project in Python and accompanying text document in Word and PDF formats. 

The master branch of this is connected to the works folder on my laptop and contains while the main file should mirror this. I have uploaded the zip file via the UCD portal containing the Python file plus the Project Report file in Word and PDF. 

The source files were too large to zip so I have uploaded them on here but the links to the files should be in the references if access to the raw files are required.
